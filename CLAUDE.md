- **Mathematical Correction**: User corrected "5 minus 1 is 4, no?!" when
  initially miscalculated as 3-band
- **Implementation**: Complete systematic removal of Peak2 for streamlined 4-band
  architecture

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Audio Processing Backend**:
   - Removed Peak2 parameters (`peak2Freq`, `peak2Gain`, `peak2Q`) from
     constructor
   - Updated EQ processing chain indices (Peak3: index 3→2, High Shelf: index
     4→3)
   - Modified `getIndividualBandResponses()` method signature and implementation
   - Removed Peak2 filter coefficient calculations

2. **User Interface Overhaul**:
   - Updated header from "5-BAND PARAMETRIC EQ" to "4-BAND PARAMETRIC EQ"
   - Removed Peak2 UI controls (`peak2FreqSlider`, `peak2GainSlider`,
     `peak2QSlider`)

2. **Audio Input Liberation**:
   - **User Issue**: "can you get rid of the audio input is muted warning? And
     maybe don't mute it!"
   - **Root Cause**: JUCE standalone wrapper auto-muting without microphone
     permissions
   - **Solution**: Enhanced CMakeLists.txt with:

     ```cmake
     JUCE_MICROPHONE_PERMISSION_ENABLED=1

  to drag the plugin into the right location?"
- **Implementation**: Industry-standard drag-and-drop DMG installer
  (`create_drag_drop_dmg.sh`)
- **Professional Features**:
  - Visual layout: Plugins (left) → Destination folders (right)
  - Symbolic links to system plugin directories
  - AppleScript-based custom positioning
  - Comprehensive README with installation guides
  - Both AU and VST3 formats in single installer
- **GitHub Release**: v1.2.2 with professional distribution system

### Development Environment Polish

- **Version Control**: Added `*.dmg` and `dmg_temp/` to .gitignore
- **Distribution Tools**: Created reusable DMG creation scripts
- **Documentation**: Updated interface messaging and build outputs
